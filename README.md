ChapterChainer
====

This script downloads serial web pages into one html file.
Available serials are:

* Wildbow (John C. McCrae):
  * [*Worm*](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/)
  * [*Pact*](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/)
  * [*Twig*](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) (as published so far)
* Scott Alexander: [*Unsong*](http://unsongbook.com/) (Authorâ€™s Notes optional)

The script follows the *Next* or *Next Chapter* link of each page, does some formatting and cleanup of the retrieved html, and outputs all chapters to one large HTML file. No Table of Contents page is required. 

Non-story remarks (announcements/greetings/etc.) on some story pages are omitted. 

See code for how to add new serials or fix broken links. 

Required
----

Python 3,
[BeautifulSoup4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/Download)

Optional
----
Alternatives to built-in html parser:

[lxml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml), [html5lib](https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python)

Usage
-----

`python3 ChapterChainer.py [Pact|Twig|Worm|Unsong]`

Unsong only: Optional switches for Author's Notes and Postscript:

`[--omit | --append | --chrono[logical]]`

`omit` skips these pages, `append` puts them after the story, and `chronological` (or `chrono`) leaves them interspersed between chapters in order of publication. 

The title argument is case sensitive.

This script must not be used to publish a serial without its author's permission. (This would severely curtail their chances to sell the manuscript, and with no money to make they may give up writing for the web altogether. Also, few could afford the punitive damage for a lost film series deal of something big like 'Worm'. Sorry for the moralizing.) Enjoy reading!
